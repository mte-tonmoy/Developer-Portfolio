            <h1>WELCOME To</h1>
            <h1><span>Toufique Elahi Tonmoy</span> World</h1>
            <h3>Enthusiastic about building things that live on the internet</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm Tonmoy. Currently, I'm doing a BSc in Computer Science & Engineering at Daffodil International
                University and I am a 3rd-year student.
                <br>
                To assess me as a focused professional looking for a creative and challenging job. Where I could
                constantly
                learn and successfully deliver my duties with responsibility and where my skills and abilities will be
                fully
                utilized. I am multilingual, and I can speak English and Bengali. I have excellent presentation skills.
                Also, I
                am interested in co-curricular activities and volunteering. I am personally a very punctual person. I
                like
                to do
                my work on time. My goal is to be a great skilled developer. My biggest strength is that I can push
                myself
                effectively to achieve my goals. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I like to watch movies or
                hang
                out
                with friends.
